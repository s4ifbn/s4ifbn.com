                            Programming languages are the languages that are used by humans to talk to computers to make
                            them do what we want. For a computer to understand us we have to use a language the computer
                            understands. Computers are electronic devices that understand the language of electricity; I
                            mean the existence of electrical charge in their complex circuits; this charge is
                            represented by two states on/off or zero/one. This language is called the machine language
                            which is represented by the binary number system so it is also called binary language. So,
                            computers understand the binary language very well, but as humans, it is impractical to
                            write programs in binary language because it is (low level) and we have to memorize every
                            instruction's binary code which is impractical and tedious. Easier languages for human
                            understanding needed to be invented.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Companies and computer scientists started inventing programming languages that are closer to
                            the human understanding level (high level), to make programming easy and more productive,
                            and since the computer revolution thousands of programming languages are written and many of
                            them are obsolete and no longer used today and some of them are still in use and new
                            programming languages are still emerging every couple of years.

                                    C programming language is considered an old programming language, and still widely
                                    used today by many companies and programmers in various areas of technology, the
                                    language was written in the early seventies by the computer scientist Dennis
                                    Ritchie, it was called C because it was derived from the B language and other
                                    languages like COBOL and Simula, B language was written by Ken Thompson who is
                                    Dennis's friend as they were working at Bell Laboratories, Ken wrote the famous UNIX
                                    operating system in C language.

                        <p>
                            The C language was updated several times from 1977 to 1979, and the standard release was in
                            the mid-eighties. It was called ANSI C, and the language was widely accepted and adopted by
                            many companies and programmers. The C programming language is considered a general-purpose
                            language and a procedural language in that the program consists of some procedures called
                            functions that perform a specific task and the main function that drives the program's
                            execution.

                                    The biggest update that happened to the C language was in 1979, when the computer
                                    scientist Bjarne Stroustrup, another friend of Dennis, added the concept of objects
                                    and classes and applied the object-oriented programming style with many new
                                    features. He called the experimental release C with classes, then the name was
                                    changed to C++. C++ has also gone through several updates and releases; every
                                    release contains several upgrades, adding new features, removing some, and so on.

                            The work is in progress on the 2023 release; you can check the official website for the

                            The main features that Bjarne added to the C language were:<br>
                            1- Added support for the OOP programming style with all its advanced features like
                            encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and other features like
                            virtual functions, exception handling, etc. we will discuss those features in Part 2 of this
                            book.<br>
                            2- Added the concept of class templates to work with generic data types.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What are the reasons that make C and C++ programming languages powerful and widely used
                            today? Here are some reasons:<br>
                            1- The C language became the base language for many other languages that are derived from
                            it, like PHP for backend web development, Java, Python, Objective-C, C#, and other
                            languages; it is also used in building the Oracle database, the UNIX, Linux, and Mac
                            operating systems, and parts of the Windows operating system.<br>
                            2- The C programming language is considered by some authors a mid-level language because it
                            contains features that allow the programmer to use it either on a high level or on a low
                            level. It provides the techniques needed to let the programmer work directly with memory and
                            device drivers. It also supports pointers, and this will make programmers write very fast
                            and efficient programs.<br>
                            3- It is considered a cross-platform language that works on any platform or operating
                            system, unlike languages like Visual Basic, which only work under the Windows environment.
                            You still need to install a compiler for each platform.<br>
                            4- The C programming language has a small number of keywords, which makes the learning
                            process easier.<br>
                            5- It supports a huge number of libraries on various topics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            C++ is not the easiest programming language to learn, but learning it and mastering all its
                            concepts will make it easy to learn any other programming language.
